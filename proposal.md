# Spell-Checking Utility Proposal

## Introduction
Spell-checking is a fundamental requirement in various text-processing applications, ensuring the correctness and readability of textual content. This proposal outlines the development of a spell-checking utility in Go, aimed at providing users with a simple yet effective tool for identifying and correcting misspelled words in text files.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a command-line utility that reads a text file, checks each word against a dictionary of known words, and identifies any misspelled words. Additionally, the utility may suggest corrections for misspelled words based on predefined rules or algorithms.

## Features
1. **File Input**: The utility will accept a text file as input, allowing users to specify the file path as a command-line argument.
2. **Spell Checking**: Each word in the input file will be checked against a dictionary of known words to identify misspellings.

## Suggestions for improvement (Stretch Challeneges)
1. **Suggestion Mechanism (stretch)**: Upon detecting a misspelled word, the utility may provide suggestions for correct spellings based on predefined rules or algorithms.
2. **User Interaction (stretch)**: Users may interact with the utility to select corrections for misspelled words, enhancing the user experience.

## Implementation Approach
The spell-checking utility will be implemented in Go, leveraging the language's simplicity, performance, and concurrency features. The following steps outline the proposed implementation approach:
1. **Input Handling**: Read the contents of the input file and tokenize the text into individual words.
2. **Dictionary**: Load a dictionary of known words into memory to facilitate spell checking.
3. **Output Results**: Display the identified misspelled words along with their suggested corrections (if applicable).

## Deliverables
The deliverables for this project include:
- A fully functional spell-checking utility implemented in Go.
- Documentation outlining usage instructions, configuration options, and implementation details.
- Code repository hosted on a version control platform (e.g., GitHub) for collaborative development and version management.

## Conclusion
The proposed spell-checking utility aims to provide users with a robust and efficient tool for identifying and correcting misspelled words in text files. By leveraging the power of the Go programming language, we can develop a lightweight and scalable solution that meets the needs of both individual users and businesses.
